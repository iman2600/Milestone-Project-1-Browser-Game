How to play
use the arrow keys to move around
avoid the red dot
collect the white dot to get points

Inspiration
to be honest when I started this I had completly different ideas for the game
unfortunately my ideas were a bit to difficult. So I went with a more simple approach
just run and collect pellets to score 10 points.

My css skills are pretty lacking so as far as things that could improve that would be one
the dots move a bit faster when moving diagonally so that could definitely be improved
I used mostly js for this game centered around drawing on the canvas element
